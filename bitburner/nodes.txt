BitNode-1: Source Genesis

The first BitNode created by the Enders to imprison the minds of humans. It became the prototype and testing-grounds for all of the BitNodes that followed.

This is the first BitNode that you play through. It has no special modifications or mechanics.

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 1, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File lets the player start with 32GB of RAM on his/her home computer when entering a new BitNode, and also increases all of the player's multipliers by:

Level 1: 16%
Level 2: 24%
Level 3: 28%


BitNode-2: Rise of the Underworld

From the shadows, they rose.

Organized crime groups quickly filled the void of power left behind from the collapse of Western government in the 2050's. As society and civlization broke down, people quickly succumbed to the innate human impulse of evil and savagery. The organized crime factions quickly rose to the top of the modern world.

In this BitNode:

The maximum amount of money available on a server is significantly decreased
The amount of money gained from crimes and Infiltration is tripled
Certain Factions (Slum Snakes, Tetrads, The Syndicate, The Dark Army, Speakers for the Dead, NiteSec, The Black Hand) give the player the ability to form and manage their own gangs. These gangs will earn the player money and reputation with the corresponding Faction
Every Augmentation in the game will be available through the Factions listed above
For every Faction NOT listed above, reputation gains are halved
You will no longer gain passive reputation with Factions

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 2, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File increases the player's crime success rate, crime money, and charisma multipliers by:

Level 1: 20%
Level 2: 30%
Level 3: 35%



BitNode-3: Corporatocracy

Our greatest illusion is that a healthy society can revolve around a single-minded pursuit of wealth.

Sometime in the early 21st century economic and political globalization turned the world into a corporatocracy, and it never looked back. Now, the privileged elite will happily bankrupt their own countrymen, decimate their own community, and evict their neighbors from houses in their desperate bid to increase their wealth.

In this BitNode you can create and manage your own corporation. Running a successful corporation has the potential of generating massive profits. All other forms of income are reduced by 75%. Furthermore: 

The price and reputation cost of all Augmentations is tripled
The starting and maximum amount of money on servers is halved
Server growth rate is reduced by 80%
You will start out with $150b so that you can start your corporation
You now only need 75 reputation with a faction in order to donate to it, rather than 150

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 3, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File lets you create corporations on other BitNodes (although some BitNodes will disable this mechanic). This Source-File also increases your charisma and company salary multipliers by:
Level 1: 8%
Level 2: 12%
Level 3: 14%

BitNode-4: The Singularity

The Singularity has arrived. The human race is gone, replaced by artificially superintelligent beings that are more machine than man. 

In this BitNode, progressing is significantly harder. Experience gain rates for all stats are reduced. Most methods of earning money will now give significantly less.

In this BitNode you will gain access to a new set of Netscript Functions known as Singularity Functions. These functions allow you to control most aspects of the game through scripts, including working for factions/companies, purchasing/installing Augmentations, and creating programs.

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 4, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File lets you access and use the Singularity Functions in other BitNodes. Each level of this Source-File will open up more Singularity Functions that you can use.

BitNode-5: Artificial Intelligence

They said it couldn't be done. They said the human brain, along with its consciousness and intelligence, couldn't be replicated. They said the complexity of the brain results from unpredictable, nonlinear interactions that couldn't be modeled by 1's and 0's. They were wrong.

In this BitNode:

The base security level of servers is doubled
The starting money on servers is halved, but the maximum money is doubled
Most methods of earning money now give significantly less
Infiltration gives 50% more reputation and money
Augmentations are more expensive
Hacking experience gain rates are reduced

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 5, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File grants you a special new stat called Intelligence. Intelligence is unique because it is permanent and persistent (it never gets reset back to 1). However gaining Intelligence experience is much slower than other stats, and it is also hidden (you won't know when you gain experience and how much). Higher Intelligence levels will boost your production for many actions in the game. 

In addition, this Source-File will unlock the getBitNodeMultipliers() Netscript function, and will also raise all of your hacking-related multipliers by:

Level 1: 4%
Level 2: 6%
Level 3: 7%

BitNode-8: Ghost of Wall Street

You are trying to make a name for yourself as an up-and-coming hedge fund manager on Wall Street.

In this BitNode:

You start with $100 million
The only way to earn money is by trading on the stock market
You start with a WSE membership and access to the TIX API
You are able to short stocks and place different types of orders (limit/stop)
You can immediately donate to factions to gain reputation

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 8, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File grants the following benefits:

Level 1: Permanent access to WSE and TIX API
Level 2: Ability to short stocks in other BitNodes
Level 3: Ability to use limit/stop orders in other BitNodes

This Source-File also increases your hacking growth multipliers by: 
Level 1: 8%
Level 2: 12%
Level 3: 14%
