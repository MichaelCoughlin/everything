The Magma 229

You stumble across a large locked chest, unlike anything you've ever seen. The lock looks rusty, you smack it with a rock, and it falls right off. Immediately the ground shakes and cracks beneath your feet, intense heat hits your face, and Magma boils up from the core.

Where one minute ago there was dirt, grass, and noxious fog, there are now rivers of molten rock (and noxious fog). You'd really like to try and repair the planet somehow, so you decide to keep pushing on. It's been working out well so far, there was some useful stuff in that chest!
The heat is tough on your Trimps, causing each zone to reduce their attack and health by 20% more than the last. 10% of your Nurseries will permanently close after each zone to avoid Magma flows, and Corruption has seeped into both Void and regular Maps, further increasing their difficulty. However, the chest contained plans and materials for the Dimensional Generator building, 478K Helium, and 100 copies of Coordination! In addition, all zones are now worth 3x Helium
